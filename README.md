#### 1. Just clone the repositories (Android code and Backend code) and build the android project.
#### 2. Head over to BuildSchemaConstants.java class to alter the IP address as the base URL for connecting the android project to the server.
#### 3. In the Command Prompt, head over to the location containing node project -> node server.js
Make sure the node-modules find themselves compatible with node version. Else re-do install the npm modules used in the project.
#### 4. You are good to go. Run the android project or test the Apis with POSTMAN
